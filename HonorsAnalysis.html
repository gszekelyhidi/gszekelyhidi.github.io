<h4>Textbook: </h4>
Kolmogorov, Fomin - Elements of the Theory of Functions and
  Functional Analysis. <br> <br>
Note that this is different from the book called
  "Introductory Real Analysis", by the same authors, although both are
  translations of the same Russian original.  
  
<h4>Grading: </h4>
Homework 30%; Quizzes 20%; Midterm 20%; Final 30%

<h4>Quizzes: </h4> There will be a short quiz <b>every second Friday,
  starting September 5</b>. Each quiz will be on the proof of a result from
  the lectures. The proofs of the theorems in the course contain many
  useful techniques in analysis and so it is important to know them
  well. The goal of the quizzes is to help you keep up with learning
  the proofs throughout the semester. <b>The lowest quiz grade will be
  dropped. </b>

<h4>Midterms: </h4> There will be one midterm exam during class, on
  <b>Friday October 17.</b> 

<h4>Final: </h4>
I will give a take home final, on the last day of class.  

<h4>Homework: </h4>
There will be fortnightly written assignments which can be found below along with the due date and time. The solutions will be posted on <a href="http://sakai.nd.edu/">Sakai</a>.<br>
<ul>
    <li> Late homework will not be accepted.
    <li> <b>The lowest homework grade will be dropped</b>.
    <li> Please staple or paper clip your work.
    <li> Don't forget to write your name on it!
    <li> You may ask others for help with your homework. However, it is 
unwise to do the homework exclusively in a group; there is no substitute for 
the insight and self confidence that comes from successful individual study.
</ul>


<h4>Honesty: </h4>This class follows the binding <a
href="http://honorcode.nd.edu/">Code of Honor</a> at Notre Dame.  The graded work you do in this class must be your own. In the case where you collaborate with other students make sure to fairly attribute their contribution to your project.

<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<h4>List of theorems: </h4>
<a href="Analysis/theorems.pdf?<? echo time(); ?>">Theorems</a>. This is a list of theorems you should know, and which you might need to prove on a quiz/exam. The list will grow as the course progresses. <a href="Analysis/theorems_hints.pdf?<? echo time(); ?>">Here</a> is the same list, with some sketched proofs for some of the theorems.<br>

<P>The dates given below for specific topics is only meant as a general
guide, and the syllabus is likely to change as the course progresses.</P>
