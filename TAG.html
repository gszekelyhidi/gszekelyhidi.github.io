            - <art_name>An introduction to bifurcation theory in

	<abstract>After being studied by engineers in practical applications (such as
buckling of rods under compressive forces), "bifurcation" was
mathematically formalized in the context of dynamical systems and
partial differential equations. Broadly speaking, bifurcation is a
phenomenon that occurs when the Implicit Function Theorem fails, due
to existence of multiple solutions. In this talk, I will give a gentle
introduction to variational bifurcation theory, first in a general
context and later specializing to geometric applications. I will
survey on how these techniques have been used in recent years to
establish a variety of multiplicity results for geometric variational
problems ranging from isoperimetric problems (e.g., constant mean
curvature hypersurfaces) to the classical Yamabe problem, on finding
constant scalar curvature metrics on a prescribed conformal class.

  <div id="renato2" style="display: none">
	<abstract>Using the background developed in Part I, I will present an
application of bifurcation techniques to a singular version of the
Yamabe problem. Given a closed Riemannian manifold M and a submanifold
S, this problem consists of finding a complete metric on the
complement of S in M that has constant scalar curvature and is
conformal to the original metric. In other words, these are (smooth) solutions
to the Yamabe problem on M that blow up along the prescribed
submanifold S. A particularly interesting case is the one where M is a
round sphere and S is a subsphere. Elementary conformal equivalences
give the existence of a trivial solution, and bifurcation provides
uncountably many new solutions when S is a great circle, via a
spectral analysis of hyperbolic surfaces. This is based on joint work
with B. Santoro and P. Piccione.

	<abstract>Bimeromorphic geometry means more or less the classification of compact complex manifolds, often under a Kaehler assumption. 
I will discuss some applications/interactions of/with model theoretic notions, including the classification of
 those compact complex manifolds  X  which are "simple", namely  X  has "few" analytic subvarieties.

	<abstract>  In this talk, we present several curvature formulas for direct images sheaves of vector bundles.
We also introduce some applications  on the  positivity and vanishing theorems for vector bundles over K&auml;hler and non-K&auml;hler manifolds,
new examples on nef but not semi-positive bundles and curvature properties of moduli spaces of curves.
